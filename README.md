# ytdlpwav1
A program to download YouTube videos in AV1 and Opus, with MKV as a container.

TODO:
from a YouTube playlist, with every downloaded video already-encoded with AV1, and Opus for audio. This program enforces this rule, even if that means re-encoding. This program relies on FFmpeg and yt-dlp being installed and added to PATH.

## Requirements
* FFmpeg (TODO: CHECK WHAT MINIMUM VERSION!)
* yt-dlp (The latest version is **heavily recommended**, as an out-of-date version can cause issues regarding downloads, either to fetch video information, or downloading the actual video)

## Configuration
*For now, this program outputs a video with a target resolution of max 1080p. You can not change this setting just yet. This is planned to be configurable in the future.*
